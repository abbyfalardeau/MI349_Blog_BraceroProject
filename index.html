    The Bracero Project was designed to bring workers to help the United States agricultural and railroad industry in WWII; however, it brought people in who were exploited by growers and separated from their families. What was life like for these men stuck in their worker existence?   
  </p1>
<h2>The Original Agreement: </h2>
  <p2>
    
    Formally called the “Emergency Farm Labor Program”, the Bracero Program started in 1942 as a response to the United States going through a shortage of agricultural and railway workers. Due to WWII, the US was having a large shift of labor into factory jobs, creating a lack of workers in agriculture and railway despite the high demand in product. The US decided to approach Mexico asking for their workers to help the greater good against the axis powers. The original plan indicated that Mexican men would be sent mostly to farms across the United States with the promise of “local prevailing wage and housing” to be provided as well as reasonably priced food and water. 
    Mexican officials saw this as a chance to modernize indigenous Mexicans, so they agreed to send 5,000 workers under a six month contract, with a condition that they would not work in Texas due to past negative experiences with racism and extremely corrupt employers.  The contract was renewable, and mandated for workers to have proper documentation for employment.

<h3> The Reality of the Program</h3>
  <p3>
    
    When Mexicans arrived at the border, they had to go through health inspections and delousing, which most the time were in dehumanizing conditions. Afterwards they were sent off in either trains, pick up trucks, or even a cattle car in some areas. Due to the multiple areas, different people had different experiences in terms of housing in the program. Some Mexican men were expected to live in chicken coops, or barns, while others lived in subpar apartments or other lackluster housing. Most worked in day-long sloop labor that was physically taxing. Growers would have them use a shorthand hoe for accuracy even though the farm workers would complain about how painful it was for their back. 
Growers took advantage of the “local prevailing wage clause” and would short the workers checks, and even come up with charges so they would owe the growers money. Growers were able to get away with this because they held the possibility of deportation over the Braceros’ heads. The program ended being renewed  does not end until 1964, this is because the profit on Mexican workers was much higher compared to using American workers because of how easy it was to exploit them. This led to growers pushing for Mexicans who didn’t qualify for the program, such as women and the elderly, to come with or without documentation leading to operations such as 
“Operation Wetback” which was meant to get people without documentation out or at least give them the documents they needed. The Bracero Program ended up bringing five million Mexican men all across the United States in the twenty-two years it ran. The railroad portion only lasts until 1945 with roughly 106,000 workers in that field.”

    <h4>Life During the Program: </h4>
    <p4>
    Life inside the bracero program wasn’t easy. Mexicans would experience discrimination in certain parts of the country, including not being allowed in certain establishments by meeting the cruel sign “No Mexicans Allowed”. Without many options men would turn to gambling and other vices. People often judged their engagement with gambling and other vices because of their status as immigrants and farm labor.  It was also hard being separated from their families, and this made Mexican women have to take on a new role. The women who stayed behind had to become the heads of their household, taking on the financial responsibility. Women were discouraged from asking their men to come home, as it was seen as questioning their logic for leaving. Women instead would send photos of themselves, memories and their families as a subtle way to call their men home, or least remind them to not go cheating on them. Some women who lived closer to the Mexican-American border would pick up domestic work as a way to go see their men while others took up sex work to visit the bracero camps, giving the impression that it was the wild west in these areas. This led to women in Mexico asking for an opportunity in domestic work to not have women go over into sex work. A way men got to keep up their happiness in the program was having religious services available like Catholic Mass.
