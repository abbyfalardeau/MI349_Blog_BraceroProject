    <h1> The Original Agreement:
    </h1>
    <p>
        Formally called the “Emergency Farm Labor Program”, the Bracero Program started in 1942 as a response to the United States going through a shortage of agricultural and railway workers. Due to WWII, the US was having a large shift of labor into factory jobs, creating a lack of workers in agriculture and railway despite the high demand in product. The US decided to approach Mexico asking for their workers to help the greater good against the axis powers. The original plan indicated that Mexican men would be sent mostly to farms across the United States with the promise of “local prevailing wage and housing” to be provided as well as reasonably priced food and water. 
        Mexican officials saw this as a chance to modernize indigenous Mexicans, so they agreed to send 5,000 workers under a six month contract, with a condition that they would not work in Texas due to past negative experiences with racism and extremely corrupt employers.  The contract was renewable, and mandated for workers to have proper documentation for employment.
