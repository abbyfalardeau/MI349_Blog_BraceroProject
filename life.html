        Life inside the bracero program wasn’t easy. Mexicans would experience discrimination in certain parts of the country, including not being allowed in certain establishments by meeting the cruel sign “No Mexicans Allowed”. Without many options men would turn to gambling and other vices. People often judged their engagement with gambling and other vices because of their status as immigrants and farm labor.  It was also hard being separated from their families, and this made Mexican women have to take on a new role. The women who stayed behind had to become the heads of their household, taking on the financial responsibility. Women were discouraged from asking their men to come home, as it was seen as questioning their logic for leaving. Women instead would send photos of themselves, memories and their families as a subtle way to call their men home, or least remind them to not go cheating on them. Some women who lived closer to the Mexican-American border would pick up domestic work as a way to go see their men while others took up sex work to visit the bracero camps, giving the impression that it was the wild west in these areas. This led to women in Mexico asking for an opportunity in domestic work to not have women go over into sex work. A way men got to keep up their happiness in the program was having religious services available like Catholic Mass.
